    To get started, you might want to try some of these simple commands to
    understand the search problem that is being passed in:

    print "Start:", problem.getStartState()
    print "Is the start a goal?", problem.isGoalState(problem.getStartState())
    print "Start's successors:", problem.getSuccessors(problem.getStartState())

    print "Does the Wumpus's stench reach my spot?", 
               \ problem.isWumpusClose(problem.getStartState())

    print "Can I sense the chemicals from the pills?", 
               \ problem.isPoisonCapsuleClose(problem.getStartState())

    print "Can I see the glow from the teleporter?", 
               \ problem.isTeleporterClose(problem.getStartState())
    
    (the slash '\\' is used to combine commands spanning through multiple lines - 
    you should remove it if you convert the commands to a single line)
    
    Feel free to create and use as many helper functions as you want.

    A couple of hints: 
        * Use the getSuccessors method, not only when you are looking for states 
        you can transition into. In case you want to resolve if a poisoned pill is 
        at a certain state, it might be easy to check if you can sense the chemicals 
        on all cells surrounding the state. 
        * Memorize information, often and thoroughly. Dictionaries are your friends and 
        states (tuples) can be used as keys.
        * Keep track of the states you visit in order. You do NOT need to remember the
        tranisitions - simply pass the visited states to the 'reconstructPath' method 
        in the search problem. Check logicAgents.py and search.py for implementation.

    # array in order to keep the ordering
